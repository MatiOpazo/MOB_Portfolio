* Found the two safest locations for a comercial store in Sao Paulo starting from a crimes database. This boroughs are North West and East 2.
* This project aims to manage differents tools about data world and does not have a comercial focus. Theres many comercial studies that have to be done before taking the best decision for a comercial store location.
* Data from Kaggle platform.
